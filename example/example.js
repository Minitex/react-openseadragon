        transcript: 'animal Goldy Ipsum. There are faint tracks across this vast campus, leading to little clandestine holes where busy Gophers play. Success is an element in which striving is attainable, but only with big teeth, endlessly gnawing at the challenge around every corner. For here, at this place, failure has no definition other than to point the way to future advancements in every aspect of what we seek. Efficiency drove them 110 feet down to create a quiet dwelling for the civil docents, where learning is a natural way to overcome structural obstacles. They exist so deep that they cannot bask in the lumination from above, for down below there are doors and no windows. The ground surrounds them as the ocean to a submarine. And on every level there is productivity, but there is no 5. East of the east bank, across the city lines, you will find a tranquil parcel, a countryside within an urban expanse. And from within this humble safe haven where panurgic gophers weave through research and scamper over theories, there is quiet. The gopher way creates a labyrinth in its complex tunnel system below the busy action above ground. They regularly constellate to victoriously seek solutions to the minatory predicaments of intricate world. Efficiency drove them 110 feet down to create a quiet dwelling for the civil docents, where learning is a natural way to overcome structural obstacles. They exist so deep that they cannot bask in the lumination from above, for down below there are doors and no windows. The ground surrounds them as the ocean to a submarine. And on every level there is productivity, but there is no 5.
